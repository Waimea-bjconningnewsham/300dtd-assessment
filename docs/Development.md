## Design, Development and Testing Log

### DATE HERE

I worked on the frist page of the project

I wrote the first couple of lines of code to get the page up and running, I used old code to do this, I decised that I would use cool colours like a light blue, I changed the text colour to black, I let the enduser take a look and got a little bit of feedback about how it should be placed.

>I would like it if it where in the middle, like front and center

I changed the layout of the website per the endusers request and moved it to be more in the middle of the page.

### DATE HERE

I built the database and designed a logo for the website

I started with a basic database building it as I went, adding to it when I needed to, taking away what I didn't need, I also wrote code to put the users login data into the database to be used again when they login again. After that I started to design the logo for my website along with a slogin for the fun of it.

> Could you make the loging in look nicer, I also really like the logo and slogin, it's really funny, it matches perfectly and really makes it a website

I changed the look of the loging in sction and made it loook cleaner than before.

### 16/07/2024

Tested the login and sign up forms to see if they where still working as intended

The login is working just fine but something is broken in the sign up so now I need to find out whats wrong and fix it.

I found out that my forms didn't match up and I quickly changed that and added more code that would tell my in advance if something was wrong. I also was able to make sign up form alot faster than before. To be spasific one of the feildnames was wrong in my signup form and my do-signup was reading the wrong feildname.

### 16/07/2024

I tested the visabilty of my website

I was making sure that when loged in the login and sign up tabs are gone and was replaced with the logout tab, and I also made sure that the logout form was working as intened as well.

So far there has been no new problems, the things I fixed seem to be stopping anything breaking again.

### 16/07/2024

I am making sure that all the date that I intend to go into the Database is going into the Database.

So far the Database is working as intended, all of the data I set to go into the Database is going into the Database in the corect places, and the other auto filling tables are filling with the corect data that they should be resiving.

All the costomer data is going into the intended Database, for the sign ups they are going into the customers table and is providing the info for when the user is loging in with their login, it is also taking the users orders once they push the 'complet order' button at the bottom of the list, the menu is showing its contents and every thing is working as intended.

### DATE HERE

I made a menu page, a home page, and contact page

I mainly did a lot of writing for the pages, a little bit of codeing here and there, to make the tabs for the pages work and for the tabs to show, I also wrote a little more for the ordoring page.

### DATE HERE

I added a function that adds up the total of the users order

I tested this by putting things into the ordering list and seeing it add up the prices of the item of the things I was ordering and then I would do the math of the ordering to see if it was the same as what was showing on the screen.

> Replace this text with any user feedback / comments

The adding was correct and I can add as many thing as I would like and the adding function would work.
