# Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Burger Town**

Project Author: **Brianna Conning-Newsham**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements 
### Identified Need or Problem

Food ordering online, with auto counting of money, and very simple.

### End-User Requirements

Must be quick and easy to navigate 
Clear and easy to read
User needs to be able to create their own customer account and login and out with their password stored securely
Have a personal feel once logged in
User needs to be able to contact me with any questions if required
Once order is made, confirmation of order needs to be displayed on screen
Prices need to be able to be updated if required and new food items added
No online payment is required as we only accept cash on delivery

### Proposed Solution

I build a website.


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

This implication means that the website I am making is usable.

In this project the website needs to work and be usable for me to get a passing grade.

I need to consider every line of feedback from my end user, changing it constently to make sure it works and can be used.

### Functionality

This means that the website needs to work as intended.

If the website doesn't work as intended to than it is not a functining website.

I will need to make sure that every thing works, so if I add something new than I need to make sure that it doesn't effect the other things in the code and make sure that I don't need to fix anything.

### Future-Proofing 

This means that the website is protected from future impacts, like adding new things to the menu

If I add something to the menu I can't let the rest of the website break while doing it or have something break after I do it.

I need to consider the fact that I will be adding new things to the menu and I will be adding things to other databases.


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant User Experience (UX) Principles

### Useful

Products and systems should be genuinely useful and fulfill a real need for a group of end-users.

If the website doesn't make it easy for clients to view a menu item, or if the site is in any way hard to use, then it is clearly not useful, and will frustrate users. Frustrated users won't bother using the system.

Right from the outset I will need to consult with the various groups of users to establish what they need from the system, and then make sure my design meets these needs.
I need to extensively test the system with all the users that will be using the system and gather feedback about their experiences.
Based on the feedback I can judge whether they find the system useful or not and alter the system accordingly

### Findable

Systems should be easily navigable, so end-users can find the content or functionality they need.

Since the users of the Burger Town website could have no IT skills at all, the system must be as simple to navigate as possible, with every function clearly findable. 

Non-technical users can find system frustrating to use when features are not clearly visible, or even hidden away (e.g. knowing that you have to swipe to delete something, rather than just having a delete button).
I need to make all navigation clear and easy to use, with no assumptions made about the abilities of the users.
The language used in the UI used must be clear and unambiguous so that there is no confusion over what any part of the system does

### Desirability

User Needs and Preferences: Desirability involves how well a feature or solution meets the needs and preferences of the end users. Itâ€™s about creating functionalities that users find useful, intuitive, and appealing.

User Engagement: In software development, the ultimate goal is often to create products that engage and satisfy users. Desirability ensures that features, interfaces, and functionalities are aligned with user preferences and needs, which enhances user engagement and satisfaction.

I will need to consider and implament all user feedback and other comments, for the most effective result in user desirability.

## Completed System

### Database Structure

This is the final database structure that I used:

-------------------------------------------------

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

The users needs have been meet as best as possible with the website design and fuctionality. Feedback from end user had been takin in and added, changes where made to adjust to the end users needs and requests.

### Meeting the System Requirements

I've meet all of the requirements that I stated at the start of the project to the fullest of my abilitys and byond. My website is easy to use for those with no knowladge of tech, it functions as intended and it is set up in a way that if anything goes wrong in the future it will be easily identifuable and fixable.


### Review of Uability

This implacation was adresed with how I designed this website, it has be labled heavily.

### Review of Funtionalitly

This implacation was adressed with how I made the website, this was done by the layout of the website, alowing me to make sure that it worked.

### Review of Future Proofing

This implacation was adressed with how I set up my website. This was done when I started making it, I was also making it with the future in mind, about what would happen if they where more people if there where more users.

### Review of Findable

My website is full of lables, everything is labled clearly.

### Review of Useful

This interface is fully usable, and it tackles a real life problem of complext ordering systems. Along with being desirabile from the end user.

### Review of Desirability

This implication has been fully satificed. I had changed and edited every aspect the end user did not like or thought could be inproved, resulting in a much smoother and functnable interface.
